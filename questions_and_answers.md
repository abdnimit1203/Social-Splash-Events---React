</div>

###### 1. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let greeting;
greetign = {};
console.log(greetign);
```

- A: `{}`
- B: `ReferenceError: greetign is not defined`
- C: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C: undefined

<i>Because here it is printing **greetign**  which is not initialized. **greeting** has been initialized. If it wasn't for the spelling mistake answer would have been **A** . So as it is logging the data **greetign** which is not initialed so it will print undefined </i>

###### 2. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, "2");
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `TypeError`
- C: `"12"`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C: "12"

<i>As the number we are passing is one numerical and another string , Javascript will automatically concat the two value sum. It won;t be numerical. Javscirpt will simply concat these two and return a strng. So the answer is **"12"**</i>

###### 3. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
const food = ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = "🍝";

console.log(food);
```

- A: `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- B: `['🍝', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- C: `['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A: `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`

<i>Original Array didn't changed. Because the variable was set inside an object and it is separated from the array as info is another object. food[0] just tooked the value not the variable was stored but the value only. SO changing the on=bject won;t change the array!</i>

###### 4. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sayHi(name) {
  return `Hi there, ${name}`;
}

console.log(sayHi());
```

- A: `Hi there,`
- B: `Hi there, undefined`
- C: `Hi there, null`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B: `Hi there, undefined`

<i>The name variable is never defined inside function . So either it has to come upon calling the function else it remains undefined.  The function takes a varible and ruetn it inside template string. But it is called without any value. So name becomes undefined while printing.</i>

###### 5. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach((num) => {
  if (num) count += 1;
});

console.log(count);
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C: 3

<i>Count is  = 0 first , forEach method iterates values of the array one by one. the array has 4 values and each time it will add 1 to it. So the count should have printed 4 but the **if** condition here is checking truthy and falsy. We know 0 is a falsy value. So for zero count +=1 will not iterate. But for other 3 times it will as they are all truthy values. So the answer is C:3 </i>
